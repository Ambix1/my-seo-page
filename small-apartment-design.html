            <h2>1. Choose a Neutral Color Palette</h2>
            <p>Neutral colors like white, beige, and soft grays make spaces feel larger and more open. Use these shades for your walls, furniture, and décor to create a cohesive and airy look.</p>
            <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Add pops of color with throw pillows, rugs, or artwork to keep the space lively.</p>

            <h2>2. Invest in Multi-Functional Furniture</h2>
            <p>Furniture that serves more than one purpose is a lifesaver in small apartments. Look for items like:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A sofa bed for overnight guests.</li>
                <li>A coffee table with hidden storage.</li>
                <li>Folding dining tables or wall-mounted desks.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why It Works:</strong> Multi-functional pieces save space and keep your home organized.</p>

            <h2>3. Use Mirrors to Create the Illusion of Space</h2>
            <p>Mirrors reflect light and make any room feel larger. Hang a large mirror on a wall or place smaller mirrors opposite windows to amplify natural light.</p>

            <h2>4. Maximize Vertical Space</h2>
            <p>When floor space is limited, go vertical!</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Install shelves above doors or windows for storage.</li>
                <li>Use tall bookcases to draw the eye upward.</li>
                <li>Hang hooks or pegboards for kitchen utensils and tools.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Create Defined Zones</h2>
            <p>In a small apartment, defining spaces is key to functionality.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use rugs to separate the living and dining areas.</li>
                <li>Add curtains or a bookshelf to act as a divider in studio apartments.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Defined zones help create the feeling of multiple rooms in one space.</p>

            <h2>6. Keep it Minimal</h2>
            <p>Clutter can make small spaces feel even smaller. Adopt a minimalist approach:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Keep only the essentials.</li>
                <li>Use concealed storage solutions to hide clutter.</li>
                <li>Stick to a few statement pieces instead of overcrowding with décor.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>7. Let in Natural Light</h2>
            <p>Natural light can transform a small space. Avoid heavy curtains or drapes and opt for sheer materials that let sunlight in.</p>
            <p><strong>Bonus Tip:</strong> Position furniture to make the most of natural light, like placing your desk near a window.</p>
